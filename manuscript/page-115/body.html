You know, Darwin studied their fertilisation, and showed that the whole structure of an ordinary orchid flower was contrived in order that moths might carry the pollen from plant to plant. Well, it seems that there are lots of orchids known the flower of which cannot possibly be used for fertilisation in that way. Some of the Cypripediums, for instance; there are no insects known that can possibly fertilise them, and some of them have never been found with seed."</p><p>"But how do they form new plants?"</p><p>"By runners and tubers, and that kind of outgrowth. That is easily explained. The puzzle is, what are the flowers for?</p></div> </div>
