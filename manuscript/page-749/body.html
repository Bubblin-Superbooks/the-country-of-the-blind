He had a vague sense of some great thing forgotten that instantaneously passed. You see that, except for the loss of his miraculous powers, everything was back as it had been, his mind and memory therefore were now just as they had been at the time when this story began. So that he knew absolutely nothing of all that is told hereâ€” knows nothing of all that is told here to this day. And among other things, of course, he still did not believe in miracles.</p></div> </div>
