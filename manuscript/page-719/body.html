He returned to the town, scared and very quiet, and went to his bedroom. "Lord!" he said, "it's a powerful gift—an extremely powerful gift. I didn't hardly mean as much as that.

Struck by a happy thought he transferred the constable to San Francisco, and without any more interference with normal causation went soberly to bed.
