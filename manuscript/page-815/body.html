He gasped out who was I, and I told him to read the inscription at my feet if he wanted to know.

All my people gave a howl of triumph, and there wasn't any more business to be done in my village after that journey, not by the likes of him.</p><p>"But, of course, I was a fool to choke him off like that. If I'd had any sense I should have told him straight away of the treasure and taken him into Co. I've no doubt he'd have come into Co.</p></div> </div>
