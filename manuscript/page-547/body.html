Something had happened, but he could not rightly determine what it was. Anyhow, he was no longer dullâ€”he felt bright, cheerful. And his throat was afire.

He got up and stood unsteadily, regarding the universe with an agreeable smile. He began to remember. He could not remember very well, because of a steam roundabout that was beginning in his head. And he knew he had been disagreeable at home, just because they wanted to be happy. They were quite right; life should be as gay as possible. He would go home and make it up, and reassure them. And why not take some of this delightful toadstool with him, for them to eat? A hatful, no less.</p></div> </div>
